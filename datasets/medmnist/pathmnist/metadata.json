    "description": "The PathMNIST is based on a prior study for predicting survival from colorectal cancer histology slides, providing a dataset (NCT-CRC-HE-100K) of 100,000 non-overlapping image patches from hematoxylin & eosin stained histological images, and a test dataset (CRC-VAL-HE-7K) of 7,180 image patches from a different clinical center. The dataset is comprised of 9 types of tissues, resulting in a multi-class classification task. We resize the source images of 3\u00d7224\u00d7224 into 3\u00d728\u00d728, and split NCT-CRC-HE-100K into training and validation set with a ratio of 9:1. The CRC-VAL-HE-7K is treated as the test set.",
